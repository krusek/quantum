This folder contains my solutions (or attempts at them) for [Microsoft's Q# coding warmup - winter 2019](https://codeforces.com/contests/1115) and [Microsoft's Q# coding contest - winter 2019](https://codeforces.com/contest/1116/). The warmup was rather easy and I got all the problems solved in a few hours. The contest was significantly harder than last years. This time I solved all but three before the contest ended and then solved another one of those the day the contest ended.
